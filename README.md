## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Css Flex: easy implementation of moving the componenets around from mobile version to desktop version.

BEM model: This naming convention helps standardize html and CSS syntax to increase its readability. 

SASS: Tried my hands on SASS for implementation of css on this project.

### Continued development

Need to standarddizeHTML and CSS implementations in further projects

### Useful resources

- [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) - This helped me to understand BEM model in a better manner and work on the implementation.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - This is the site for SASS. I found a lot of usefull articles for implementation of css using SASS
